Default Compute Cluster is Azure Kubernetes
Attached Compute option can have services attached like Azure DataBricks and Azure HDInsight
For deploying model as a webservice, defauly option available is Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster, other option available is Azure Machine Learning SDK

QUIZ 1:

1. When you deploy a trained model as a web service, Azure Machine Learning creates an inference pipeline.
2. You build a machine learning experiment in Azure Machine Learning studio by connecting modules into a pipeline that data flows through.
3. Which of the following is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm? --> clustering
4. In machine learning, when data is labeled this means that each piece of training data has a label with the “answer.”
5. An Azure Machine Learning dataset is a pointer to a specific file in a datastore or other data source.

QUIZ 2:

1. In Azure Machine Learning, the pipeline data object is a special kind of data reference that is used to pass data from the output of one pipeline step to the input of another, creating a dependency between them.
2. In Azure Machine Learning, datastores refer to storage locations, such as Azure Storage blob containers.
3. In the Azure Machine Learning SDK, a run object represents a single trial of an experiment.
4. In Azure Machine Learning, runs are used to monitor the asynchronous execution of a trial, log metrics, and store your output of the trial.
5. Which of the following lists correctly presents the web service deployment process for an Azure Machine Learning model? --> a) Define an inference configuration. b) Define a deployment configuration. c) Deploy the model as a web service.
